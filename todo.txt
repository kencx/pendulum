Pendulum project to do:

pendulum.py
add driving force and air resistance
error check?

methods.py:
DONE: Write out different methods of integration to solve dynamics of system (Euler, RK)
Develop Lagragian and Hamiltonian methods to solve dynamics of system

animation.py:
incorporate save as mp4 function
different colours for different pendulums


Graph out variables of pendulum (theta1 against theta 2, acc and vel over time etc.)
develop simluation of multiple pendulums with minute difference in mass/length/angle
develop energy check to monitor energy drift
